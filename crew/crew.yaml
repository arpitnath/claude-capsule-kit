        - ALL file reads: Read('{WORKTREE_PATH}/path/to/file')
        - ALL git commands: Bash('cd {WORKTREE_PATH} && git ...')
        - NEVER operate in {PROJECT_ROOT} (main branch)

        Available tools:
        - Workflows: /workflow, /debug, /deep-context
        - Sub-agents: architecture-explorer, refactoring-specialist
