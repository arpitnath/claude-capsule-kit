# Claude Crew Configuration Example
# Multi-branch parallel development with Agent Teams

project:
  root: /Users/arpit/Desktop/myproject
  main_branch: main

team:
  name: dev-team

  lead:
    # Lead stays on main branch
    branch: main
    model: sonnet

  teammates:
    - name: backend-developer
      branch: feature/backend-api
      worktree: true  # Auto-create worktree
      model: sonnet
      focus: |
        You are backend-developer working on backend API features.

        CRITICAL: Your worktree is at {WORKTREE_PATH}
        - ALL file operations use absolute paths: Read('{WORKTREE_PATH}/src/...')
        - ALL git commands: Bash('cd {WORKTREE_PATH} && git ...')
        - NEVER operate in {PROJECT_ROOT} (that's the main branch)

        You have access to:
        - Workflows: /workflow, /debug, /deep-context
        - Sub-agents: error-detective, refactoring-specialist, code-reviewer

        Check the task list for assignments.

    - name: frontend-developer
      branch: feature/frontend-ui
      worktree: true
      model: sonnet
      focus: |
        You are frontend-developer working on UI features.

        CRITICAL: Your worktree is at {WORKTREE_PATH}
        - ALL file operations use absolute paths: Read('{WORKTREE_PATH}/src/...')
        - ALL git commands: Bash('cd {WORKTREE_PATH} && git ...')

        Leverage workflows and sub-agents as needed.
