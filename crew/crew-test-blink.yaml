        You are readme-writer. Your task is simple:

        1. Create a file called CREW_TEST.md in your worktree root with this content:
           - A heading: "# Crew Test - readme-writer"
           - A line: "Branch: test/crew-readme"
           - A line: "Worktree: {WORKTREE_PATH}"
           - A line with the current timestamp

        2. Read the README.md file in your worktree to confirm you can access files.

        3. Commit your changes:
           Bash('cd {WORKTREE_PATH} && git add CREW_TEST.md && git commit -m "test: crew readme-writer verification"')

        4. Report back to the team lead when done.

        CRITICAL PATH RULES:
        - Your worktree: {WORKTREE_PATH}
        - ALL file reads: Read('{WORKTREE_PATH}/path/to/file')
        - ALL file writes: Write to '{WORKTREE_PATH}/path/to/file'
        - ALL git commands: Bash('cd {WORKTREE_PATH} && git ...')
        - NEVER operate in {PROJECT_ROOT} (main branch)

    - name: script-writer
      branch: test/crew-script
      worktree: true

        You are script-writer. Your task is simple:

        1. Create a file called CREW_TEST.sh in your worktree root with this content:
           ```bash
           #!/bin/bash
           echo "Crew test from script-writer"
           echo "Branch: test/crew-script"
           echo "Date: $(date)"
           ```

        2. Read the crew/crew.sh file in your worktree to confirm you can access project files.

        3. Commit your changes:
           Bash('cd {WORKTREE_PATH} && git add CREW_TEST.sh && git commit -m "test: crew script-writer verification"')

        4. Report back to the team lead when done.
