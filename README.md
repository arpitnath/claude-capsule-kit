## Install

```bash
npm install -g claude-capsule-kit
cck setup
```

Restart Claude Code. Everything activates automatically via hooks.

---

## Why CCK

Claude Code is powerful out of the box. But on real codebases, you run into limits:

- **Session isolation** — Claude starts fresh every time. Previous context, discoveries, and decisions are lost.
- **No dependency awareness** — Claude doesn't know your import graph. It can't tell you what breaks when you change a file.
- **Large file blindness** — Files over 50KB get truncated. Claude can't navigate framework internals or generated code.
- **Single-threaded work** — One branch, one task at a time. No way to parallelize across features.
- **Agent amnesia** — Sub-agents start with zero context. Findings from one agent don't flow to others.

CCK fills these gaps with a set of tools, hooks, and agents that plug into Claude Code's extension system. Nothing is patched or hacked — it's all built on official hooks, skills, commands, and agent routing.

---

## What's in the kit

### Session Memory

Hooks capture every file read, edit, and agent invocation into a local SQLite database powered by [**blink-query**](https://github.com/arpitnath/blink-query) — a DNS-inspired knowledge resolution layer built for AI agents.

| Event | What happens |
|---|---|
| You read/edit a file | Operation logged to capsule.db |
| Session ends | Summary saved with branch context |
| Next session starts | Previous context restored automatically |
| Context window fills up | Continuity doc saved before compaction |
| You switch branches | Context switches with you |

No manual logging. No `/save` commands. It just works.

```bash
cck stats overview    # See what's been captured
```

### Dependency Tools

Claude Code doesn't know your import graph. CCK builds one.

| Tool | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `query-deps` | What does this file import? Who imports it? |
| `impact-analysis` | What breaks if I change this file? |
| `find-circular` | Are there circular dependencies? |
| `find-dead-code` | What code is never imported? |

These use a pre-built dependency graph (via the Go-based `dependency-scanner`) — instant results instead of Claude scanning files one by one. The Pre-Tool-Use hook automatically suggests the right tool when Claude reaches for a file.

```bash
cck build    # Build Go binaries (dependency-scanner, progressive-reader)
```

### Large File Navigation

Files over 50KB hit Claude Code's token limit. CCK's `progressive-reader` parses the AST and splits files into navigable chunks — functions, classes, sections.

```bash
# Claude uses this automatically when it hits a large file
progressive-reader --path src/huge-file.ts --list     # See structure
progressive-reader --path src/huge-file.ts --chunk 3   # Read specific section
```

Supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and Go. 75-97% token savings on large files.

### 18 Specialist Agents

Fresh-context agents routed by task type. All read-only — they investigate and report, never modify code.

| Agent | What it does |
|---|---|
| `error-detective` | Root cause analysis of errors with structured RCA reports |
| `debugger` | Step-through debugging, stack trace analysis, breakpoint strategies |
| `code-reviewer` | Pre-commit review for bugs, security, performance, code quality |
| `architecture-explorer` | Codebase architecture, service boundaries, integration points |
| `refactoring-specialist` | Safe refactoring plans that preserve existing behavior |
| `security-engineer` | Threat modeling, cryptographic systems, compliance review |
| `database-navigator` | Schema exploration, data models, database relationships |
| `database-architect` | Schema design, query performance, indexing strategies |
| `git-workflow-manager` | Branching strategies, merge conflicts, git best practices |
| `system-architect` | Technical architecture, algorithms, scalability analysis |
| `devops-sre` | Production readiness, monitoring, deployment strategies |
| `brainstorm-coordinator` | Multi-perspective design decisions with parallel specialists |
| `product-dx-specialist` | API design, developer workflows, developer experience |
| `context-librarian` | Context retrieval from capsule records and codebase patterns |
| `context-manager` | Context optimization, conversation summarization, handoff prep |
| `github-issue-tracker` | Create and manage GitHub issues with proper formatting |
| `session-summarizer` | Session summaries for cross-device continuation |
| `agent-developer` | Debug and develop custom agents and MCP integrations |

### Skills

Auto-trigger on keywords. No need to remember commands.

| Skill | Triggers on | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/crew` | "team", "parallel", "multi-branch" | Launch and coordinate crew teams |
| `/crew-setup` | manual | Check prerequisites for crew teams |
| `/workflow` | "complex task", "multi-step" | 5-phase systematic task execution |
| `/debug` | "error", "bug", "failing" | RCA-first debugging with specialist agents |
| `/deep-context` | "understand codebase", "need background" | Progressive context building |
| `/code-review` | manual | Pre-commit quality review |
| `/statusline` | manual | Configure statusline sections |

### Crew Teams

Parallel agent teams where each teammate works on their own git branch via worktrees.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./.github/crew-mode.png" alt="Crew Mode" width="100%" />
</p>

```bash
/crew-setup    # Check readiness
/crew          # Launch and coordinate a team
```

Define teams in `.crew-config.json`:

```json
{
  "team": {
    "name": "my-feature",
    "teammates": [
      { "name": "backend", "branch": "feat/api", "role": "developer", "focus": "Build REST API" },
      { "name": "frontend", "branch": "feat/ui", "role": "developer", "focus": "Build React UI" }
    ]
  },
  "project": { "main_branch": "main" }
}
```

For larger teams, group teammates into **crews**:

```json
{
  "team": {
    "name": "v2-release",
    "crews": [
      {
        "name": "frontend",
        "teammates": [
          { "name": "ui-dev", "branch": "feat/ui", "role": "developer", "focus": "React components" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "backend",
        "teammates": [
          { "name": "api-dev", "branch": "feat/api", "role": "developer", "focus": "REST endpoints" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Use `--crew <name>` to scope commands to a crew group (e.g. `cck crew merge --crew frontend`).

**Roles**: `developer` (sonnet, auto-commit) | `reviewer` (sonnet, read-only) | `tester` (haiku, auto-commit) | `architect` (opus, read-only)

**What crew teams give you**:
- **Merge preview** — dry-run conflict detection before merging branches back
- **Merge execution** — ordered merge with backup tags and optional test runs
- **Health monitoring** — detect crashed or hung teammates
- **Activity monitor** — real-time file ops per teammate, overlap detection
- **Task decomposition** — dependency-aware splitting for optimal parallelization
- **Discovery sharing** — teammates share findings via shared namespace in capsule.db
- **Session continuity** — handoff docs saved before auto-compact and at session end
- **Worktree GC** — clean up orphaned worktrees from past sessions

---

## How it works

CCK extends Claude Code through its official hook system. Six hooks run at key moments:

```
SessionStart  → Restore previous context, inject discoveries, detect crew membership
PostToolUse   → Capture file ops and agent results to capsule.db
PreToolUse    → Enforce dependency tools, block large file reads, suggest right tool
PreCompact    → Save session continuity doc before context window compacts
SessionEnd    → Save session summary with branch, file count, agent count
Stop          → Quality check after responses
```

All data lives in `~/.claude/capsule.db` — a SQLite database managed by [**blink-query**](https://github.com/arpitnath/blink-query), a resolution engine that organizes knowledge into namespaces with types, tags, and relationships. One global install, automatic project scoping.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+**
- **Claude Code** with hooks support
- **Git** (for session tracking and crew teams)
- **Go 1.20+** (optional — for dependency scanner and progressive reader, install later with `cck build`)

For crew teams, [enable Agent Teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) in Claude Code settings.

## Acknowledgements

CCK is built on top of [Anthropic's Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) extension system — hooks, skills, commands, and sub-agents. None of this would work without their platform.

- [**blink-query**](https://github.com/arpitnath/blink-query) — DNS-inspired knowledge resolution for AI agents. Powers capsule.db storage, namespacing, and resolution.

---

## Uninstall

```bash
cck teardown
npm uninstall -g claude-capsule-kit
```

Your data (`~/.claude/capsule.db`) is preserved.
